                                    The document verification process for various states differs state to state. It can be online where students must upload original scan documents on the counselling portal or it can be offline where students must go to a nodal center / Institute taking their original documents to verify them.
                                    Expert Educational Consultancy provide the list of documents and all the other information related to the same.

                                    Students can get knowledge about the admission eligibility criteria of each state from the Information Bulletin provided at the MCC/State counselling website. But taking knowledge for all state’s eligibility criteria is too time consuming and is not enough to get admission. Even after going through this information bulletin, you will be having some queries which can only be sought out by a counsellor or a consultancy.
